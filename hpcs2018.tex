% *** Authors should verify (and, if needed, correct) their LaTeX system  ***
% *** with the testflow diagnostic prior to trusting their LaTeX platform ***
% *** with production work. IEEE's font choices can trigger bugs that do  ***
% *** not appear when using other class files.                            ***
% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[10pt, conference, compsocconf]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsocconf option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex

\section{Introduction} \label{Introduction}

\section{Model} \label{Model}

\subsection{The Qarnot rendering platform}

Qarnot cloud (Q.rads, Q.ware, Q.render)

\subsection{Ray tracing rendering}

theoretical formulation

Existing implemenation in Q.render

\subsection{Optimization problem}

We only have square decomposition. We want to compute 
more balanced decompositions in exploring rectangular decompositions. 
Add illustrations with different splitting runtime  (examples you have)

\section{An adaptive approach} \label{TwoPhases}

\subsection{Principle}

Explain that we will make a workload estimation and then we will compute the 
balanced decomposition

Picture that summarizes the approach

\subsection{Implementation model}

Explain how the principle is implemented with Q.ware. Mention software 
components to develop.

Explain the limits of the model (the scheduling will not necessarily be optimal ...)


\subsection{Workload estimation}

Define the problem (given a piece of an image, we want to know what is the runtime of the rendering)

Define the method to solve the problem (Fine grain decomposition of the image and then 
make a noisy rendering to estimate the duration)

Say why the method could work (Monte Carlo theory ...)

Say what are the limits: 

 - what is the noise level we consider for rendering? This is the 

old dilema between exploration and exploitation.
 - What is the right decomposition grain?


\subsection{Load balancing}

Define the problem (we have an estimation of a fine grain decomposition, what is the best 
partitioning in N rectangles?)

Recall that it is a classical NP hard problems

Say that there exist several algorithms. But they are not efficient to capture irregular decompositions.

Present the Tetris algorithm as a solution for more irregular decompositions

Put the pseudo code

\section{Experimental evaluation} \label{Experimental}

Present the dataset

Results of the file prepared for the Blender conf

Analyze the strong and weak points of Tetris

Strong: 
Explain that in general tetris is more interesting when we have more rectangles 
or when the optimal decomposition has a too irregular shape.
 Show some shapes (decomposition) that cannot be captured by the other algorithms. 

Weak points: Show that we tend to have smaller rectangles at the top.
Illustrate on an example.

Recommend the perfect image for Tetris...
