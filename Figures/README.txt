This document contains the result of the liearity analysis between the rendering time and the number of samples or the resolutions. "linearity_analysis.py" is the python script which I have used in in this stage. "linearity_data.csv" is the rendering time data. "linear_model_coefficient.csv" is the results of linear regression of the data. The documents contain the pictures of the fitting lines of the linear regression. The synthetic work is to model all different sample or resolution data by using only one model.
